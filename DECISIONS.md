# DECISIONS LOG — sim2real

Append-only. Record every resolved question with date, decision, and rationale. Number entries `D1, D2, …`. Do not edit or delete past entries; supersede them with a new entry that references the old one.

Hardware-track decisions made before this repo existed live in the course repo (`henkaku-center/aps/DECISIONS.md`); the ones that bind this project are summarized in `HANDOVER.md` (two-brain architecture, LOLIN S2 Mini baseline, tethered-first power policy, 50% servo spares).

## D1. Repository scope and stack (2026-07-23)

**Decision:** Separate repo (`henkaku-center/sim2real`), not a subdirectory or submodule of the course site. MuJoCo as the cross-platform reference core; Gymnasium + Stable-Baselines3 student-facing; MJX/Warp workstation-only; LeRobot for datasets; first-party `@mujoco/mujoco` WASM + Vite for the browser; Wokwi for ESP32-S2 firmware logic tests.

**Rationale:** See `ROADMAP.md` ("Cross-platform reality check") — the course site is deliberately build-free and must stay so; submodules are agent- and student-hostile; MuJoCo is the only physics core first-class on both macOS and Linux; the accelerated paths are all NVIDIA/Linux.
